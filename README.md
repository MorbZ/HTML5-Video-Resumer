This extension will automatically remember at which time you left HTML5 videos and will resume them when played again. The times for played videos are saved up to 1 month.

It supports all HTML5 video formats including MP4 and WEBM. Flash videos are not supported.

It doesn't work for sites that change the video URLs on every page visit yet, such as Youtube and Netflix. However, often times those sites have build in video resume support.
